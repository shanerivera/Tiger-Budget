# Tiger-Budget
Intro. to Software Engineering Final Project

This project was done with a team of 4 others.
I came up with the concept of the Tiger Budget program, which tells you what foods you can get on-campus 
with dining dollars at Auburn University while also budgeting for the rest of the semseter.

I was the Project Manager throughout the process of developing this project.
Everyone contributed to the dictionaries, and I focused on the code that follows
which contains the calculations and statements to find what foods fit your budget.
